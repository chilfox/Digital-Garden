# Linear Classifier Network
## Lecture 02: Image Classification

This lecture introduces the computer vision task - image classification. Then we explain a naive approach K nearest neighbor

- [[D-DL4CV-Lec02-Image_Classification]]


## Lecture 03: Linear Classifier & Regularization

This lecture introduces linear classifier and the concept of regularization.
- **Linear classifier**: An image classification method that enables the model learn from the training data
- **Regularization**: A method which enable us to tell the model our preference toward the final model and prevent overfitting
