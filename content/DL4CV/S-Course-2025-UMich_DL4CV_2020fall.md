# Linear Classifier Network
## Lecture 02: Image Classification

> This lecture introduces the computer vision task - image classification. Then we explain a naive approach K nearest neighbor

- [[D-DL4CV-Lec02-Image_Classification]]


## Lecture 03: Linear Classifier & Regularization

> This lecture introduces linear classifier and the concept of regularization.
> - **Linear classifier**: An image classification method that enables the model learn from the training data
> - **Regularization**: A method which enable us to tell the model our preference toward the final model and prevent overfitting

- [[D-DL4CV-Lec03-Linear_Classifier]]

## Lecture 04: Optimization
> In the previous lecture, we learned the loss function which tells us how good our model is performing currently.
> In this lecture, we introduces "optimization", which is the process utilizing the loss we've computed to improve the model
