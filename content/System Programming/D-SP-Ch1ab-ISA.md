# Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
## What is ISA?

ISA is a set of instructions defined by the hardware manufacturer which tell us what are the basic operations that the hardware can do

## How does ISA works?

First, developers will follow the ISA and write assembly codes, such as `Add 3 5`.

Next, the assembler turn the assembly code into machine language following ISA's instructions, e.g., `0100110011`
