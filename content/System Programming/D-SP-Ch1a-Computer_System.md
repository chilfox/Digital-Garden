# Introduction

A computer system consists of hardware, system programs, and application programs

## Application Programs

Application programs are the programs that the user interacts with directly

## System Program

These are the programs that manage and control the hardware. It creates a platform for other software to run

It consists of **compilers**, **editors**, **command interpreter**, and most importantly, the **operating system**

The operating system creates an interface which is the same in every kinds of hardware, thus we can transplant application programs easily to all kinds of devices. We'll discuss it later
## Hardware

Hardware is the foundational computing platform that consists of both the physical components and the set of basic instructions the hardware can perform
